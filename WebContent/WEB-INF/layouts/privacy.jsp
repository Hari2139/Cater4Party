	Privacy Policy<br /> Version Date: 10.01.2015

	<h2>GENERAL</h2>

	<p>CaterRequest ("CaterRequest" or "we" or "us" or "our") respects
		the privacy of its users ("user" or "you") whether they use our
		website located at www.CaterRequest.com, including other media forms
		and media channels related or connected thereto, and our mobile
		applications (collectively, the "Website") to order food from local
		restaurants, to advertise food for sale or simply to view the Website.
		The following CaterRequest privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is
		designed to inform you about the types of information that
		CaterRequest may gather about or collect from or about you in
		connection with your use of the Website. It also is intended to
		explain the conditions under which CaterRequest uses and discloses
		that information, and your rights in relation to that information.</p>
	<h2>GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AND
		NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
	<h2>Users of the Website Generally</h2>
	<p>Like most website operators, CaterRequest automatically gathers
		from Website users non-identifying information of the sort that Web
		browsers and mobile devices, depending on their settings, may make
		available. That information includes may include a user's Internet
		Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the
		locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at,
		while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website.</p>

	<p>CaterRequest uses this information, as well as other information
		described in this Privacy Policy, to operate, maintain, enhance and
		provide all features of the Website, to provide services and
		information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and
		otherwise to provide support to users, and to process and deliver
		entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered
		from time to time on the Website. CaterRequest also analyzes this
		automatically collected information to help CaterRequest better
		understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and
		trends in usage, CaterRequest is able to better design the Website to
		improve users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use.
		From time to time, CaterRequest may also release automatically
		collected information gathered from Website users in aggregated forms,
		such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.
		Finally, CaterRequest may use this information to operate, maintain,
		enhance and provide all features of the Website, to provide services
		and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions
		and otherwise to provide support to users, and to process and deliver
		entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered
		from time to time on the Website.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>

	<p>A "cookie" is a string of information that a website stores on a
		user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website
		each time the user submits a query to the site. CaterRequest uses
		Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website
		session, both to help CaterRequest improve users' experiences and to
		help CaterRequest understand how the Website is being used. As with
		other non-identifying information we gather from users of the Website,
		CaterRequest analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information
		gathered using cookies, so as to help CaterRequest, its partners and
		others better understand how the Website is being used. CaterRequest
		does not attempt to link information gathered using cookies to
		Personal Information. CaterRequest users who do not wish to have
		cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse
		cookies before accessing the Website, with the understanding that
		certain features of the Website may not function properly without the
		aid of cookies. Website users who refuse cookies assume all
		responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.</p>

	<h2>Web Beacons</h2>

	<p>A "Web Beacon" is an object that is embedded in a web page or
		email that is usually invisible to the user and allows website
		operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or
		an email. C aterRequest may use Web Beacons to count users who have
		visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded
		services. Web Beacons are not used to access users' Personal
		Information, as described below; instead, they are a technique
		CaterRequest may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website
		usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including
		cookie data, the time and date of a page or email view, and a
		description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You
		may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered mostly
		ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting
		to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept
		or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>

	<h2>Aggregated Non-Personal Information</h2>

	<p>We may share aggregated and thus non-identifying information we
		collect under any of the circumstances described above. We may also
		share this information with third parties and our affiliate companies

		to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Website and on
		websites of third parties. We may combine non-identifying information
		we collect with other non-identifying information collected from or by
		other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third
		parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the
		purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may
		tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the
		most popular features or services accessed. This information does not
		contain any Personal Information and may be used to develop website
		content and services that we hope you and other users will find of
		interest and to target content and advertising.</p>

	<h2>Location Information</h2>

	<p>We may obtain information about your physical location, such as
		by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by
		inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP a
		ddress indicates the general geographic region from which you are
		connecting to the Internet).</p>

	<h2>Third Party Cookies, Web Beacons and Buttons.</h2>

	<p>We may display third-party content on the Website, including
		third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web
		beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with
		your viewing of the third party content on the Website. Additionally,
		we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook "like" or
		"share" buttons) that may function as Web Beacons even when you do not
		interact with the button. Information collected through third-party
		Web Beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties,
		not by CaterRequest. Information collected by a third party in this
		manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and
		disclosure policies.</p>

	<p>As one example, we use Google Analytics to collect and process
		certain analytics data; Google provides some additional privacy
		options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</p>

	<h2>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

	<h2>Website Registration</h2>

	<p>"Personal Information" is information such as a name or email
		address that, without more, may be directly associated with a specific
		person. CaterRequest collects a range of Personal Information from and
		about Website users. Much of the Personal Information collected by
		CaterRequest about users is information provided by users themselves
		at the time they register with the Website and purchase food. That
		information may include your name, address, email address, and
		telephone number and, if you transact business with us, financial
		information such as your payment method (valid credit card number,
		type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may
		request information about your interests and activities, your gender,
		age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic
		information, and other potentially relevant information as determined
		by CaterRequest from time to time. Users of the Website are under no
		obligation to provide CaterRequest with Personal Information of any
		kind, although refusing to do so may prevent the user from using
		certain Website features.</p>

	<p>We may also periodically obtain both Personal Information and
		non-identifying information about you from other
		CaterRequest-affiliated businesses, business partners, contractors and
		other third parties and add it to our account information or other
		information we have collected. Examples of information that we may
		receive include: updated address information, purchase history, and
		additional demographic information.</p>

	<p>We may also offer you the opportunity to log in to the Website
		by using credentials you have established with a third party website
		or application (such as your Google account) (each such account, a
		"Connected Account"). In such cases, we do not obtain information from
		these Connected Accounts beyond the information you and the Connected
		Account service provider provide to us in connection with logging into
		our Website.</p>

	<h2>Online Forums and Public Postings; Other Collections</h2>

	<p>Certain Personal Information we collect about users is provided
		to us as a result of those users' use of the Website. We provide areas
		on our Websites where you can post information and reviews about
		restaurants. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In
		addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when general
		web searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also,
		whenever you voluntarily disclose Personal Information on
		publicly-viewable web pages, that Personal Information will be
		publicly available and may be collected and used by others. For
		example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited
		messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users
		may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you
		to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal
		information. You assume all responsibility for any loss of privacy or
		other harm resulting from your voluntary disclosure of Personal
		Information.</p>

	<h2>CaterRequest Communications</h2>

	<p>We may occasionally use your Personal Information, including
		your name and email address, to send you notifications regarding new
		services offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable.
		We may also send you service-related announcements from time to time
		through the general operation of the service. Generally, you may opt
		out of such emails at the time of registration or through your account
		settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your
		account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>

	<h2>CaterRequest Disclosures</h2>

	<p>CaterRequest will disclose Personal Information or other
		information under the following circumstances: By Law or to Protect
		Rights. When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with
		efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding
		illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and
		defend the rights, property or safety of our CaterRequest, our users,
		our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate
		with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other
		agreements or policies, in response to a subpoena or similar
		investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from
		a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise
		our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise
		required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal
		objection or right available to us. Direct mail partners. From time to
		time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of
		goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not
		to receive mailings from these providers, you may opt-out at the time
		you register for our Website, or at any time thereafter by going to
		your account settings or contacting us using the contact information
		below. Marketing Communications. Unless users opt-out from receiving
		CaterRequest marketing materials upon registration, CaterRequest will
		email users about products and services that CaterRequest believes may
		be of interest to them and CaterRequest also will provide users' email
		information to third parties, so that those third parties may directly
		contact users about additional products and services. If a user wishes
		to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from CaterRequest or
		having their email information provided to third parties at any time
		after registration, users may do so by going to your account settings
		or contacting us using the contact information below. Even after
		opting-out, a user may continue to receive marketing emails from third
		parties to whom CaterRequest already has provided the user's email
		information. Users will be responsible for directly contacting such
		third parties to request cessation of further marketing emails.
		Restaurants. Whenever a user places an order for food from a
		restaurant, CaterRequest will transfer all information to the
		restaurant necessary for preparing and processing the order. On
		occasion, this may include transferring credit card and other payment
		information in cases where a restaurant, rather than CaterRequest, is
		processing the payment. Users will need to contact restaurants
		directly to determine the privacy policies that apply to the
		information that CaterRequest transfers to the restaurants. Third
		Party Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information, which
		may include your name and contact information (including email
		address) with our authorized service providers that perform certain
		services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders,
		providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing
		business and sales analysis, supporting our website functionality, and
		supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered
		through our Website. We may also share your name, contact information
		and credit card information with our authorized service providers who
		process credit card payments, or enable such authorized service
		providers to interact directly with you to collect such information.
		These service providers may have access to Personal Information needed
		to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such
		information for any other purpose. Business Transfers; Bankruptcy.
		CaterRequest reserves the right to transfer any or all information,
		including any Personal Information, in its possession to a successor
		organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy or
		other sale of all or a portion of CaterRequest's assets. Other than to
		the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and
		disclosure of all transferred Personal Information will be subject to
		this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are given
		notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to
		affirmatively opt-out of it. Personal Information submitted or
		collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy
		policy adopted by the successor organization.</p>

	<h2>Changing Personal Information: Account Termination</h2>

	<p>You may at any time review or change the Personal Information we
		maintain about you by going to your account settings or contacting us
		using the contact information below. Upon your request, we will
		deactivate or delete your account and contact information from our
		active databases. Such information will be deactivated or deleted as
		soon as practicable based on your account activity and accordance with
		our deactivation policy and applicable law. To make this request,
		either go to your account settings or contact us as provided below. We
		may retain in our files some Personal Information to prevent fraud, to
		troubleshoot problems, to assist with any investigations, to enforce
		our Terms of Use and to comply with legal requirements as is permitted
		by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all Personal Information
		about you will be completely removed from our databases in response to
		your requests. Additionally, we keep a history of changed information
		to investigate suspected fraud with your account.</p>

	<h2>General Use</h2>

		activities on the Website to: deliver the products and services that
		you have requested, manage your account and provide you with customer
		support, communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone and/or

		problems. In particular, we may examine your Personal Information to
		identify users using multiple user IDs or aliases. We may compare and
		review your Personal Information for accuracy and to detect errors and
		omissions. We may use financial information or payment method to

		connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that
		survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this
		Privacy Policy only in non -identifying, aggregated forms.</p>

	<h2>EMAIL TO FRIENDS FEATURE AND REFERRAL PROGRAM</h2>

	<p>CaterRequest may offer users the ability to send friends emails

	<h2>THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h2>

	<p>CaterRequest contractually prohibits its contractors,
		affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personal Information
		received from CaterRequest, other than in accordance with this Privacy
		Policy. Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this
		Privacy Policy, however, with respect to Personal Information that
		users provide directly to those third parties or that those third
		parties collect for themselves. CaterRequest neither owns nor controls
		the third-party websites accessible through the Website. Thus, this
		Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered
		by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party,
