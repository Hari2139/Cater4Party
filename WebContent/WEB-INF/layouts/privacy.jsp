<p>Welcome to CaterRequest.com (the “Site”) and the Cater Request, Inc. mobile application (the “Mobile Application”). This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Cater Request, Inc. (“we”, “us” and “our”) collects, handles and uses personal information collected from users of the Site, the Mobile Application and their services (“Services).  By using the Site, the Mobile Application or Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Policy. </p> 

<h2>What personal information do we collect?</h2> 

<p>“Personal information” is information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, email address and telephone number.  We collect the following personal information from users that register to use the Services on the Site or the Mobile Application: first and last name, email address, postal or physical address, phone or other contact information and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).</p>

<p>We may also collect such personal information when users access certain documents or services on the Site or the Mobile Application, when users respond to surveys, when users participate in contests, sweepstakes and other marketing promotions and when users send an inquiry or other communication to us. </p>

<p>The submission of personal information is voluntary.  However, you may not be able to access certain services or features on the Site or the Mobile Application unless register and provide such personal information.  We may use the personal information we collect in the following ways relating to our business:</p>
<ul>
	<li> to develop, enhance, market sell or otherwise provide information, products or services;</li>
	<li> to process purchases or other transactions through the Site or the Mobile Application;</li>
	<li> to contact and  respond to any communications from users;</li>
	<li> to conduct or administer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions in which you have participated;</li>
	<li> to customize the user’s experience or homepage on the Site or the Mobile Application; and</li> 
	<li> to develop and manage our business and operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>We may also use such personal information to enforce the Terms and Condition for use of the Site or the Mobile Application or this Privacy Policy, to detect and protect us and other third parties against error, negligence, breach of contract, fraud, theft and other illegal activity, to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements or provisions; or for any other purpose to which a user might consent.</p>

<p>We may also track non-personal information about web pages and content accessed by visitors (see Cookies below) to the Site or the Mobile Application and the number of times such content is accessed by a specific user.  We may collect this non-personal information to improve the quality of the Site, the Mobile Application and the products and services offered through the Site or the Mobile Application.</p> 

<p>We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet).</p>

<h2>To whom do we disclose personal information?</h2>

<p>In order to facilitate the placement of food orders with a caterer who is part of the Cater Request network, we will transfer all information to the caterer necessary for preparing and processing the order. On occasion, this may include transferring credit card and other payment information in cases where a restaurant, rather than Cater Request, is processing the payment. Users will need to contact restaurants directly to determine the privacy policies that apply to the information that Cater Request transfers to the restaurants.</p>

<p>In addition, we may disclose personal information we collect in the following situations:</p> 

<ul>
	<li> We may disclose personal information to third parties (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) that we use to assist us in providing our services, subject to similar obligations of confidentiality to those contained in this Policy;</li>
	<li> We may disclose personal information where you have specifically authorized us to do so in connection with registering at the Site or the Mobile Application or in some other written communication;</li>
	<li> We may disclose personal information if required by law, court and administrative agency order, subpoena or other legal action or by law enforcement; </li>
	<li> We may disclose person information if it is found that your use of the Site or the Mobile Application violates our Terms and Conditions, policies, or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by Cater Request to protect Cater Request’s legal rights and/or property or the rights and/or property of third parties; and</li>
	<li> Finally, we may disclose personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business that this Policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. </li>
</ul>

<p>We may also share aggregate demographic, statistical and other information regarding use of the Site, the Mobile Application, and other products and services, with third parties for marketing and other purposes, but such aggregate information will not specifically identify any particular user. </p>
