	<h2>TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT</h2>
	<p>In order to maintain the level of quality that we're striving
		very hard to attain and maintain, by using this website or the
		CaterRequest Services, you are agreeing to abide by these Terms of Use
		(the "Terms"), which constitute a legally binding agreement between
		you and CaterRequest, ("CaterRequest") and which govern your use of
		and access to the CaterRequest.com website (including the webpages
		contained or hyperlinked therein and owned or controlled by
		CaterRequest, the "Website") and the CaterRequest Services, whether
		through the website itself or through such other media or media
		channels, devices, software, or technologies as CaterRequest may
		choose from time to time (also and collectively, the "CaterRequest
		Service(s)").</p>
	<p>As provided in greater detail in these Terms (and without
		limiting the express language of the Terms below), you agree and
		acknowledge that the Terms include the following material terms:
	<ul>
		<li>Your use of the CaterRequest Services may be subject to
			separate third party terms of service and fees, including without
			limitation your mobile network operator's (the "Carrier") terms of
			service and fees, including fees charged for data usage, messaging
			and overage, which are your sole responsibility;</li>
		<li>The CaterRequest Services are provided "as is" without
			warranties of any kind and CaterRequest's liability to you is
			limited;</li>
		<li>If you have an CaterRequest account, you may receive coupons
			when using the CaterRequest Service which can only be used on the
			CaterRequest Service within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
			coupon.</li>

			CLASS ACTION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to

			agreement to arbitrate any disputes with CaterRequest; and</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Please note that if you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which
		you reside (generally under the age of 18), you must have the
		permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal
		guardian to use the Website and the CaterRequest Services, and your
		parent or legal guardian must read and agree to these Terms prior to
		your using the Website and the CaterRequest Services. Notwithstanding
		the foregoing, however, persons under the age of 13 are not permitted
		to register for the Website or use the CaterRequest Services.</p>
	<p>The Website is owned and operated by CaterRequest,
		("CaterRequest"), and is currently hosted in the United States.
		CaterRequest reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily
		or permanently, and at any time, the Website and/or the CaterRequest
		Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that
		CaterRequest shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any
		modification, suspension or discontinuance of the CaterRequest
		Services.</p>
	<p>Please note that CaterRequest may modify these Terms from time
		to time, and any change to these Terms will be reflected on the
		Website (with revisions being indicated by date), and you agree to be
		bound to any changes to these Terms when you use the Website or the
		CaterRequest Services. CaterRequest may also, in its sole and absolute
		discretion, choose to alert via email all users with whom it maintains
		email information of such modifications. It is therefore important
		that you regularly review these Terms and keep your contact
		information current in your account settings to ensure you are
		informed of any such changes. Modifications to these Terms shall be
		effective 30 days after being posted but shall not apply
		retroactively. Also, occasionally there may be information on the
		Website or within the CaterRequest Services that contains
		typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to
		service descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other
		information, and CaterRequest reserves the right to correct any
		errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update the
		information at any time, without prior notice.</p>

	<h2>The Website and the CaterRequest Services</h2>
	<p>The Website and the CaterRequest Services are a third-party
		marketplace for customers ("Customers") to view, discuss, and place
		orders for food and beverages, and pick- up and/or delivery services
		in connection therewith, with participating restaurants (the
		"Restaurants"). CaterRequest provides order placement services only.
		CaterRequest is not a merchant of food or beverages, or provider of
		any pickup or delivery services in connection therewith, and does not
		control the Restaurants or the production of any food or beverages, or
		any pick-up or delivery services therewith.</p>
	<p>The Restaurants have entered into agreements with CaterRequest
		to comply with federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and
		standards pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing and safety.
		CaterRequest, including the Website and the CaterRequest Services,
		does not in any way independently verify the credentials or
		representations of any of the Restaurants, the ingredients or the
		quality of any their products or services, or any Restaurant's
		compliance with applicable laws.</p>
	<p>Customers using the CaterRequest Services must make themselves
		comfortable through the information provided by the Restaurants on the
		Website, by contacting the Restaurants directly, or through such other
		means or methods as they may deem appropriate, as to the quality and
		reliability and quality of the Restaurants and the Restaurants'
		compliance with applicable laws. CaterRequest, including the Website
		and the CaterRequest Services, does not in any way guarantee the
		quality of any Restaurant or any food or beverage, or any pickup- up
		or delivery service in connection therewith, or any compliance thereof
		with applicable laws. In addition, a Restaurant may represent certain
		standards with respect to their food preparation (or other services),
		such as "organic," "kosher," "macrobiotic" or allergen- specific
		standards such as "nut-free," "gluten-free," or "lactose-free";
		CaterRequest does not investigate or verify any such representations.
		CaterRequest shall not be liable or responsible for any food or
		beverages, or any other services, offered by the Restaurants or any
		errors or misrepresentations made by them (including on the Website
		and through the CaterRequest Services).</p>
	<p>We do take customer satisfaction very seriously and, in addition
		to contacting the applicable Restaurant directly, we ask that you
		notify CaterRequest of all complaints or concerns that you might have
		regarding the Restaurants.</p>

	<h2>ORDERING AND PAYMENT</h2>
	<p>When you place an order through the CaterRequest Services, you
		will be given a choice of payment options, which may include via
		credit card, PayPal®, and direct payment to the applicable Restaurant.
		If you pay for your purchase via credit card or PayPal, we will ask
		for a valid credit card or PayPal account, as applicable, which will
		be billed through the CaterRequest Services, for the purchase price of
		the applicable order, and "CaterRequest" will be the name that appears
		on the credit card or PayPal statement, as applicable. As stated
		above, however, CaterRequest, including the Website and the
		CaterRequest Services, is not and shall not in any manner be
		considered the seller of any of the food, beverages, and services
		ordered.</p>

	<h2>REFUND POLICY</h2>
	<p>CaterRequest takes customer satisfaction very seriously. If you
		have any problems with your order, we ask that you contact the
		Restaurant directly, but, if you have not been able to resolve your
		issue with the Restaurant to your satisfaction, please contact
		CaterRequest and we will try to assist you. In appropriate cases, if
		you have already been billed by CaterRequest, CaterRequest may issue
		full or partial refunds, or "Cash Coupons".</p>

		the Website or the CaterRequest Services. You may terminate your use
		or participation at any time, for any reason, by either ceasing to use

		PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, CaterRequest RESERVES THE RIGHT TO, IN

		ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE WEBSITE AND THE CaterRequest SERVICES, TO ANY
		PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON AT ALL, INCLUDING WITHOUT
		LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY OR COVENANT
		CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS, OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION, AND
		CaterRequest MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE WEBSITE
		AND THE CaterRequest SERVICES, DELETE YOUR PROFILE AND ANY CONTENT OR
		INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN
		CaterRequest'S SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION.</p>
	<p>Any provisions of these Terms that, in order to fulfill the
		purposes of such provisions, need to survive the termination or
		expiration of these Terms, shall be deemed to survive for as long as
		necessary to fulfill such purposes.</p>

	<h2>ADDITIONAL TERMS</h2>
	<p>Your use of the CaterRequest Service is subject to any and all
		additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the
		CaterRequest Service or certain features of the CaterRequest Service
		that we may post on or link to on the CaterRequest Service (the
		"Additional Terms"), such as end- user license agreements for any
		downloadable applications that we may offer, or rules applicable to
		particular features or content on the CaterRequest Service. All such
		Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a
		part of, these Terms.</p>

	<h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
	<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California
		without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court
		proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and CaterRequest agree
		to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state
		courts and federal courts located within Sacramento County, CA for the
		purpose of litigating any dispute. We operate the CaterRequest Service
		from our offices in Sacramento, and we make no representation that the
		CaterRequest Services are appropriate or available for use in other
		locations.</p>

	<h2>DISPUTES</h2>
	<p>If there is a dispute between users of the Website, or between
		users and any third party (including any Restaurant), you understand
		and agree that CaterRequest (including the Website and the
		CaterRequest Services) is under no obligation to become involved. In
		the event that you have any such dispute between users and any third
		party (including any Restaurant), you hereby release CaterRequest
		(including the Website and the CaterRequest Services), its directors,
		officers, employees, service providers, affiliates, agents and
		successors from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and
		consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected
		and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any
		way related to such disputes. In the interest of resolving disputes
		between you and CaterRequest in the most expedient and cost effective
		manner, you and CaterRequest agree that every dispute arising in
		connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.
		Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses
		a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more
		limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited
		review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief
		that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes
		all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms,
		whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or
		any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises
		during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND
		AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CaterRequest ARE
		EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
		ACTION. Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we
		both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,
		preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring
		an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement
		action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that
		action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or
		(d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property
		infringement claim. Any arbitration between you and CaterRequest will
		be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the
		Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,
		"AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as
		modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA
		Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling
		the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting CaterRequest. A party who
		intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the
		dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature
		required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by
		electronic mail ("Notice"). CaterRequest's address for Notice is:
		CaterRequest, , 3466 Data dr, Apt 1222, Rancho Cordova, CA 95670. The
		Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
		dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We
		agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if
		we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice
		is received, you or CaterRequest may commence an arbitration
		proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
		made by you or CaterRequest must not be disclosed to the arbitrator
		until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.
		If our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor,
		CaterRequest will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount
		awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement
		amount offered by CaterRequest in settlement of the dispute prior to
		the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000. If you commence arbitration
		in accordance with these Terms, CaterRequest will reimburse you for
		your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than
		$10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the
		AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be
		agreed upon in Sacramento County, California, but if the claim is for
		$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
		conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
		arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or
		(c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the
		county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds
		that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the
		Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by
		the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
		then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In
		that case, you agree to reimburse CaterRequest for all monies
		previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay
		under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration
		is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision
		sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which
		the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make
		rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of
		fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request
		from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on
		the merits. YOU AND CaterRequest AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
		AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
		PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
		PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and CaterRequest agree otherwise,
		the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and
		may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
		proceeding. If CaterRequest makes any future change to this
		arbitration provision (other than a change to CaterRequest's address
		for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice
		within 30 days of the change to CaterRequest's address for Notice, in
		which case your account with CaterRequest will be immediately
		terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately
		prior to the amendments you reject will survive. If the paragraph
		above regarding class or representative proceedings is found to be
		unenforceable or if the entirety of this Disputes Section is found to
		be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes Section will be
		null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive
		jurisdiction and venue described in Governing Law Section will govern
		any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
