<h2>The Site, the Mobile Application and the Services</h2>

<p>The Site, the Mobile Application and the Services are a third-party marketplace for customers (“Customers”) to view, discuss, and place orders for catering services with participating caterers and restaurants (the “Caterers”). Cater Request is not a merchant of food or beverages, or provider of any pickup or delivery services in connection therewith, and does not control the Caterers or the production of any food or beverages, the provision of catering services therewith or any pick-up or delivery services therewith.</p>

<p>The Caterers have entered into agreements with Cater Request to comply with federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing and safety. Cater Request, including the Site, the Mobile Application and the Services, does not in any way independently verify the credentials or representations of any of the Caterers, the ingredients or the quality of any their products or services, or any Caterer’s compliance with applicable laws.</p>

<p>Customers using the Services must make themselves comfortable through the information provided by the Caterers on the Site, by contacting the Caterers directly, or through such other means or methods as they may deem appropriate, as to the quality and reliability and quality of the Caterers and the Caterers’ compliance with applicable laws. Cater Request, including the Site, the Mobile Application and the Services, does not in any way guarantee the quality of any Caterer or any food or beverage, or any catering, pickup- up or delivery service in connection therewith, or any compliance thereof with applicable laws. In addition, a Caterer may represent certain standards with respect to their food preparation (or other services), such as “organic,” “kosher,” “macrobiotic” or allergen-specific standards such as “nut-free,” “gluten-free,” or “lactose-free”; Cater Request does not investigate or verify any such representations. Cater Request shall not be liable or responsible for any food or beverages, or any other services, offered by the Caterers or any errors or misrepresentations made by them (including on the Site or the Mobile Application and through the Services).</p>

<p>We do take customer satisfaction very seriously and, in addition to contacting the applicable Caterer directly, we ask that you notify Cater Request of all complaints or concerns that you might have regarding the Caterers.</p>

<h2>ORDERING AND PAYMENT</h2>

<p>When you place an order through the Cater Request Services, you will be given a choice of payment options, which may include via credit card, PayPal&reg;, and direct payment to the applicable Caterer. If you pay for your purchase via credit card or PayPal, we will ask for a valid credit card or PayPal account, as applicable, which will be billed through the Cater Request Services, for the purchase price of the applicable order, and “Cater Request” will be the name that appears on the credit card or PayPal statement, as applicable. As stated above, however, Cater Request, including the Site and the Cater Request Services, is not and shall not in any manner be considered the seller of any of the food, beverages, and services ordered.</p>

<h2>REFUND POLICY</h2>

<p>If you have any problems with your services from the Caterer, we ask that you contact the Caterer directly, but, if you have not been able to resolve your issue with the Caterer to your satisfaction, please contact Cater Request and we will try to assist you. In appropriate cases, if you have already been billed by Cater Request, Cater Request may issue full or partial refunds, or credit.</p>

<h2>ADDITIONAL TERMS</h2>

All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.</p>

<h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>

<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you and Cater Request agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Sacramento County, California, for the purpose of litigating any dispute. We operate the Service from our offices in Rancho Cordova, and we make no representation that the Cater Request Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>

<h2>DISPUTES</h2>

<p>If there is a dispute between users of the Site or the Mobile Application, or between users and any third party (including any Caterer), you understand and agree that Cater Request (including the Site, the Mobile Application and the Services) is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have any such dispute between users and any third party (including any Caterer), you hereby release Cater Request (including the Site, the Mobile Application and the Services), its directors, officers, employees, service providers, affiliates, agents and successors from all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes.</p>

<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cater Request in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cater Request agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CATER REQUEST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

<p>Despite the provisions of the paragraph directly above, we both agree that nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

<p>Any arbitration between you and Cater Request will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Cater Request.</p>

<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or if we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Cater Request’s address for Notice is: Cater Request, Inc., 3466 Date Drive, #1222, Rancho Cordova, CA 95670. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cater Request may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Cater Request must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Sacramento County, California. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Cater Request for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>

<p>YOU AND CATER REQUEST AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Cater Request agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p>If Cater Request makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Cater Request’s address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cater Request’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Cater Request will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</p>

<p>If the paragraph above regarding class or representative proceedings is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Disputes Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes Section will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Governing Law Section will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
